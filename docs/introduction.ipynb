    "The Threat Hunter Playbook is a community-driven, open source project to share detection logic, adversary tradecraft and resources to make detection development more efficient. All the detection documents in this project follow the structure of [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) categorizing post-compromise adversary behavior in tactical groups and are available in the form of [interactive notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html#the-jupyter-notebook-format). The use of notebooks not only allow us to share text, queries and expected output, but also code to help others run detection logic against [pre-recorded security datasets](https://securitydatasets.com) locally or remotely through [BinderHub](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) cloud computing environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expedite the development of techniques an hypothesis for hunting campaigns.\n",
    "* Help security researchers understand patterns of behavior observed during post-exploitation.\n",
    "* Share resources to validate analytics locally or remotely through cloud computing environments for free.\n",
    "* Map pre-recorded datasets to adversarial techniques.\n",
    "* Accelerate infosec learning through open source resources.\n",
